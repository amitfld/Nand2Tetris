# 🚀 Nand2Tetris

Welcome to my **Nand2Tetris** repository! 🌟 This space documents my journey through the [Nand2Tetris course](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)—an exciting computer science curriculum where I build a computer system from **scratch**, starting with NAND gates and culminating in a working computer 💻 capable of running programs.

## 📝 Course Overview

The Nand2Tetris course is designed to explore the **fundamentals of computer science** by guiding students to construct a fully functional computer system from the ground up. It combines elements of:

- 🛠️ **Hardware design**
- 💾 **Software development**
- ⚙️ **Operating system concepts**
