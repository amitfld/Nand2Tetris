# Nand2Tetris
Welcome to my Nand2Tetris repository! This space documents my journey through the [Nand2Tetris course](https://www.nand2tetris.org/), an exciting computer science curriculum where I build a computer system from scratch, starting with NAND gates and culminating in a working computer capable of running programs.
## Course Overview
The Nand2Tetris course is designed to explore the fundamental principles of computer science by guiding students to construct a fully functional computer system from the ground up. The course combines elements of hardware design, software development, and operating system concepts.
## Repository Structure
This repository is organized according to the course's project structure. Each folder corresponds to a specific module or project:
- **Project 1: Boolean Logic**
-- Implementation of fundamental logic gates using NAND gates.
