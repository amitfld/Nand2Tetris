# Nand2Tetris
Welcome to my Nand2Tetris repository! This space documents my journey through the [Nand2Tetris course](https://www.nand2tetris.org/), an exciting computer science curriculum where I build a computer system from scratch, starting with NAND gates and culminating in a working computer capable of running programs.

## Course Overview
The Nand2Tetris course is designed to explore the fundamental principles of computer science by guiding students to construct a fully functional computer system from the ground up. The course combines elements of hardware design, software development, and operating system concepts.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized according to the course's project structure. Each folder corresponds to a specific module or project:
- **Project 1: Boolean Logic**
  - Implementation of fundamental logic gates using NAND gates.
- **Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic**
  - Construction of basic arithmetic logic units (ALUs).
- **Project 3: Sequential Logic**
  - Design of flip-flops and memory units.
- **Project 4: Machine Language**
  - Development of the Hack assembly language.
- **Project 5: Computer Architecture**
  - Creation of the Hack CPU and Memory system.
- **Project 6: Assembler**
  - Implementation of an assembler for the Hack platform.
- **Project 7 & 8: Virtual Machine (VM Translator)**
  - Building a stack-based virtual machine and translator.
- **Project 9: High Level Language - Building a Game**
  - Designing and implementing a simple game using the Jack programming language. Check out the [Traffic Racer Game](google.com) here
- **Project 10 & 11: Building a Compiler**
  - Designing and completing the Jack compiler.

## Tools and Languages
- **Hardware Description Language (HDL):** For designing logic gates and computer architecture.
- **Jack Programming Language:** For building the game.
- **Java:** For implementing the Assembler.
- **Python:** For implementing the VM Translator and Jack Compiler.
- **Assembler and Virtual Machine Tools:** To bridge hardware and software development.

## Goals
- Build a deeper understanding of how computers work.
- Develop a functional computer system from first principles.
- Document the journey to aid others who are taking this course.
